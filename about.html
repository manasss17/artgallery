    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Manas, a 20-year-old passionate artist with a love for pencil shading and watercolor techniques. I specialize in creating detailed landscapes and expressive portrait artworks. I've been dedicated to the craft of drawing and painting since I was 8 years old. Over the years, I've also explored various styles and forms, including Mahumane art, Mandala art, and works inspired by Jamini Roy. My art reflects a deep connection to tradition, emotion, and the natural world.</p>
    <p>I continuously seek to improve my skills and broaden my artistic horizons. My work aims to tell stories and evoke emotions, whether through subtle pencil tones or vibrant watercolor strokes. I'm deeply inspired by nature, cultural motifs, and human expressions. I take pride in translating personal moments and ideas into meaningful pieces of art that resonate with my clients. Each commission is an opportunity to connect, create, and contribute beauty to someoneâ€™s space. With every piece I produce, I strive to make art that is not only visually captivating but also heartfelt and enduring.</p>
